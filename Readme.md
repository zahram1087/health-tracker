## Feature Tasks
###Finger Exercises
One key part of health is building finger strength and endurance. On the main page, display a number and a button. The number should increase when the button is clicked.

Stretch goal: the app should show encouraging messages as the user passes milestones in their button-clicking (perhaps a message at every 10 clicks, and serious props at every 50).

###Stopwatch
Still on the main page, add a stopwatch. Have a button to [Start/Pause] and [Reset] the clock. The start/pause button should toggle between saying “start” and “pause.” And you should only be able to reset when the stopwatch is paused.

Have the view update as fast as possible while still leaving the buttons responsive.

Display the clock as 0:00:00.000 so it should be able to track up to 9 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds and 999 milliseconds.

###Inspiring Image Carousel
At the top of our main page, we want to inspire our users with images of the type of person they can become. Display an image with a caption below it. (The caption should NOT be part of the image; it should be text.) Allow users to cycle through images and read the captions. Pressing next should go to the next image and its caption, pressing prev should go back. The app should display a (1/N), (2/N) … indicator so users know how many items are in the list.

* You may choose the images and captions. Have fun.

* Your app must use a class to model the images and their captions. Use the class to manually instantiate each unique item. Add all of the items to an array.

* Your app should use the array of image objects to cycle through what it’s showing.
